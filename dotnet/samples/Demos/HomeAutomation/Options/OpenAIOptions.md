# Explanation
This C# class defines configuration options for OpenAI settings within a Home Automation project. The `OpenAIOptions` class contains properties for the Chat Model ID and the API Key which are required for authenticating and interacting with the OpenAI service. It uses data annotations to enforce that these properties must be provided. The class also specifies a constant `SectionName` which likely corresponds to the configuration section name in a settings file (e.g., appsettings.json).
