# Explanation
This C# code defines a simple plugin class `MyAlarmPlugin` within the `HomeAutomation.Plugins` namespace. The plugin demonstrates how to create a plugin with dependencies that can be injected via constructor dependency injection. It depends on another plugin `MyTimePlugin` which is passed in through the constructor. The `SetAlarm` method is marked as a kernel function with a description attribute and accepts a time string to set an alarm. The actual alarm-setting logic is not implemented here; it only shows where that code would go and references the injected `timePlugin`.

    {
        // Code to actually set the alarm using the time plugin would be placed here
        _ = timePlugin;
    }
