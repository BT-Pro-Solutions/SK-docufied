# Explanation
This C# code provides an extension method for the `IHttpClientBuilder` interface, which is commonly used in .NET to configure `HttpClient` instances in dependency injection scenarios. The extension method, `ClearResilienceHandlers`, removes any already configured resilience handlers (specifically instances of `ResilienceHandler`) from the HTTP message handler pipeline of the `HttpClientBuilder`. This allows developers to clear out previously added resilience policies or handlers before configuring new ones. The code also includes a remark with a link to a related GitHub issue, indicating the motivation and context for this method. The warning `EXTEXP0001` is suppressed during the execution of this method.
