# Explanation
This C# code defines the entry point for a Windows Forms application called "HuggingFaceImageTextDemo". The Main method initializes some application configuration settings (such as high DPI support or default fonts) and then runs the main form of the application, which is represented by the FormMain class. The program uses the standard Windows Forms application model and includes a reference to application configuration initialization guidance.

namespace HuggingFaceImageTextDemo;

internal static class Program
{
    /// <summary>
    ///  The main entry point for the application.
    /// </summary>
    [STAThread]
    public static void Main()
    {
        // To customize application configuration such as set high DPI settings or default font,
        // see https://aka.ms/applicationconfiguration.
        ApplicationConfiguration.Initialize();
        Application.Run(new FormMain());
    }
}
```
