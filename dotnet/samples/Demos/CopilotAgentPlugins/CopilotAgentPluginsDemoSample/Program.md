# Explanation
This C# program sets up a command-line application using the Spectre.Console.Cli library. It creates a `CommandApp` instance, configures it by adding a command called "demo" (which should correspond to a definition of a `DemoCommand` class elsewhere in the project), and runs the application with any command-line arguments passed to it.

using Spectre.Console.Cli;

var app = new CommandApp();
app.Configure(config =>
{
    config.AddCommand<DemoCommand>("demo");
});

return app.Run(args);
```
