# Explanation
This C# code defines a simple data model class named `ProductInfo`. It is used as an object within the `GatherProductInfoStep` process step, presumably part of a larger processing workflow. The class includes three string properties: `Title`, `Content`, and `UserInput`, each initialized to an empty string and representing the product's title, content, and user comments respectively.
