# Explanation
This C# code defines a sealed class named Product, representing a product entity suitable for use with an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) such as Entity Framework. The class is decorated with .NET attributes to map its properties to database columns and provide metadata for documentation and UI generation. The Product class includes properties for an auto-generated ID, product name, price in USD, and a computed creation date. Each property is optional (nullable), and is described using the Description attribute for clarity.
