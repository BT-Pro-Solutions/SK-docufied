# Explanation
This C# code defines a simple class named `Location` within the `SemanticKernel.AotCompatibility.Plugins` namespace. The class encapsulates geographic location information by storing a country and a city as string properties. It includes a constructor that initializes these properties when a new `Location` object is created.

internal sealed class Location
{
    public string Country { get; set; }

    public string City { get; set; }

    public Location(string country, string city)
    {
        this.Country = country;
        this.City = city;
    }
}
