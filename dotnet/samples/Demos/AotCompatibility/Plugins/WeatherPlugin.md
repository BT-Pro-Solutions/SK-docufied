# Explanation
This C# code defines a `WeatherPlugin` class within the `SemanticKernel.AotCompatibility.Plugins` namespace. The class contains a method `GetCurrentWeather` that provides a simple, hardcoded weather report for specific cities. It returns a `Weather` object with temperature and condition based on the input `Location`'s city name. The method is decorated as a kernel function for integration with Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework and includes a description attribute.
