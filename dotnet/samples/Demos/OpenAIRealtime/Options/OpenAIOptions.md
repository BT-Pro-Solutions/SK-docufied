# Explanation
This C# file defines a configuration class `OpenAIOptions` used for managing settings related to the OpenAI service. It includes a property to hold the OpenAI API key and a read-only property to validate whether the API key is set (i.e., non-empty). This configuration class can be used to bind application settings typically stored in a configuration file under the section named "OpenAI".
