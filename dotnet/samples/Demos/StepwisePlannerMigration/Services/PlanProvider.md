# Explanation

This C# code defines a `PlanProvider` class in the `StepwisePlannerMigration.Services` namespace. Its purpose is to retrieve previously generated plans from files for demonstration purposes. The class implements the `IPlanProvider` interface and provides a `GetPlan` method, which reads a file from the `Resources` directory, deserializes its contents into a `ChatHistory` object using `System.Text.Json`, and returns it. This is useful for loading chat histories for testing or showing example scenarios in applications that use chat-based semantic kernels.
