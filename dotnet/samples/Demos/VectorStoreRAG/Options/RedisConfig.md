# Explanation
This C# code defines a configuration class for Redis settings within the context of a .NET application, likely used for an AI-powered Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The class, RedisConfig, is marked as internal (accessible within the same assembly) and is intended to bind configuration values from a section named "Redis" in the application's configuration files. It includes a property, ConnectionConfiguration, which is required and intended to store the Redis connection string or configuration details. The property uses data annotation to enforce that a value must be provided.

/// </summary>
internal sealed class RedisConfig
{
    public const string ConfigSectionName = "Redis";

    [Required]
    public string ConnectionConfiguration { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
```
