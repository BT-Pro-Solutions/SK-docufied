# Explanation

This C# code defines a generic internal sealed class `TextSnippet<TKey>` within the `VectorStoreRAG` namespace. The class is intended to model a section or snippet of text that is associated with both metadata (such as a key, optional reference description, and optional link) and a vector embedding (an array of floats, likely for use in vector search, semantic retrieval, or AI-driven tasks). The class uses attributes from the `Microsoft.Extensions.VectorData` namespace to annotate properties for integration with a vector store or database system. The `[VectorStoreRecordVector(1536)]` attribute suggests that the vector embedding should have a dimensionality of 1536, which is common for certain OpenAI or Azure embeddings.

    [VectorStoreRecordVector(1536)]
    public ReadOnlyMemory<float> TextEmbedding { get; set; }
}
