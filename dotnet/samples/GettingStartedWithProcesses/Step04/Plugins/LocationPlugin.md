# Explanation
This C# code defines a simple mock plugin named `LocationPlugin` within the `Step04.Plugins` namespace. The plugin offers three methods to provide location informationâ€”current location, home location, and office location. Each method is decorated with the `KernelFunction` attribute which indicates that these methods are meant to be used as functions callable within the Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework. Additionally, each method includes a description attribute for clarity on the location information it provides. The locations are hardcoded as strings representing city, region, and country.
