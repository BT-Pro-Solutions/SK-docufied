# Explanation
This C# code defines a class named `LastStep` which inherits from `KernelProcessStep`. It is part of a series of process steps likely used within the Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework. The class contains a single asynchronous method, `ExecuteAsync`, which is marked as a kernel function and, when executed, prints a message indicating it is the final step in a process.

using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;

namespace Step00.Steps;

public sealed class LastStep : KernelProcessStep
{
    [KernelFunction]
    public async ValueTask ExecuteAsync(KernelProcessStepContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Step 4 - This is the Final Step...\n");
    }
}
