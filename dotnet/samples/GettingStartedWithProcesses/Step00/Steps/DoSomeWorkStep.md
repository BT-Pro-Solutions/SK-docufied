# Explanation
This C# code defines a step in a process workflow using the Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework. The `DoSomeWorkStep` class, which inherits from `KernelProcessStep`, contains an asynchronous method `ExecuteAsync` decorated with the `[KernelFunction]` attribute. When executed, this method outputs a simple message to the console indicating that work is being done in step 2 of the workflow.

using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;

namespace Step00.Steps;

public sealed class DoSomeWorkStep : KernelProcessStep
{
    [KernelFunction]
    public async ValueTask ExecuteAsync(KernelProcessStepContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Step 2 - Doing Some Work...\n");
    }
}
```
