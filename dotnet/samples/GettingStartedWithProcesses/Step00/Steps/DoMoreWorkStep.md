# Explanation
This C# code defines a class `DoMoreWorkStep` that represents a step in a process using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework. The class inherits from `KernelProcessStep` and contains a single asynchronous method `ExecuteAsync` marked with the `[KernelFunction]` attribute, indicating it is a kernel-executable function. When executed, the method prints a message to the console indicating that it is performing additional work (Step 3 in a sequence).

using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;

namespace Step00.Steps;

public sealed class DoMoreWorkStep : KernelProcessStep
{
    [KernelFunction]
    public async ValueTask ExecuteAsync(KernelProcessStepContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Step 3 - Doing Yet More Work...\n");
    }
}
