# Explanation
This C# code defines a mock step class, `CRMRecordCreationStep`, for use within a semantic kernel processing workflow. The class simulates the creation of a new CRM (Customer Relationship Management) record. It contains a single asynchronous method, `CreateCRMEntryAsync`, which logs a creation message and emits an event indicating that a new CRM record entry has been created. This is a placeholder meant to be replaced by actual API calls to create CRM entries in a real implementation.

{
    public static class Functions
    {
        public const string CreateCRMEntry = nameof(CreateCRMEntry);
    }

    [KernelFunction(Functions.CreateCRMEntry)]
    public async Task CreateCRMEntryAsync(KernelProcessStepContext context, AccountUserInteractionDetails userInteractionDetails, Kernel _kernel)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[CRM ENTRY CREATION] New Account {userInteractionDetails.AccountId} created");

        // Placeholder for a call to API to create new CRM entry
        await context.EmitEventAsync(new() { Id = AccountOpeningEvents.CRMRecordInfoEntryCreated, Data = true });
    }
}
