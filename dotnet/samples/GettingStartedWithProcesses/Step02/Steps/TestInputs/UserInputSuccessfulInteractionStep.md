# Explanation
This C# code defines a class `UserInputSuccessfulInteractionStep` which inherits from `ScriptedUserInputStep`. It overrides the `PopulateUserInputs` method to add a sequence of user input strings to the provided `UserInputState`. These inputs simulate a successful interaction scenario where the user wants to open a new account, providing personal details like name, date of birth, location, phone number, user ID, and email. This class is presumably part of a scripted step process used in testing or automation within the context of user input handling.
