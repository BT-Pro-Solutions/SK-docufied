# Explanation
This C# code defines a mock step class `NewMarketingEntryStep` that simulates creating a new marketing user entry within a process managed by the Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework. The class contains a single asynchronous method `CreateNewMarketingEntryAsync` which logs the creation of a new account using the provided user details and emits an event indicating that a new marketing entry has been created. This example is likely used for testing or demonstration purposes, representing how to integrate marketing entry creation within a larger workflow.

    }

    [KernelFunction(Functions.CreateNewMarketingEntry)]
    public async Task CreateNewMarketingEntryAsync(KernelProcessStepContext context, MarketingNewEntryDetails userDetails, Kernel _kernel)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[MARKETING ENTRY CREATION] New Account {userDetails.AccountId} created");

        // Placeholder for a call to API to create new entry of user for marketing purposes
        await context.EmitEventAsync(new() { Id = AccountOpeningEvents.NewMarketingEntryCreated, Data = true });
    }
}
