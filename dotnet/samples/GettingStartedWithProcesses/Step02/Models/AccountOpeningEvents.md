# Explanation
This C# code defines a static class `AccountOpeningEvents` which contains a collection of string constants representing various event names related to the account opening process. Each constant is declared as `public static readonly string` and uses the `nameof` operator to assign its own identifier as the value. This approach helps avoid hardcoding string literals, improves maintainability, and reduces errors associated with typos when referring to event names elsewhere in the application. The class is intended for use in scenarios like those in the `Step02a_AccountOpening` and `Step02b_AccountOpening` samples, serving as a centralized repository of event names pertinent to customer onboarding workflows, verification checks, fraud detection, CRM updates, marketing entries, and customer communication.
