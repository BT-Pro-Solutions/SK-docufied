# Explanation
This C# code defines a data model representing details of user interactions related to an account within a service context. The `AccountUserInteractionDetails` record contains a unique account identifier (`AccountId`), a transcript of the conversation with the user (`InteractionTranscript`), and the type of user interaction (`UserInteractionType`). The enumeration `UserInteractionType` specifies possible types of interactions, such as complaints, requests for account information, or opening a new account. This model is intended for use in specific sample applications related to account opening.
