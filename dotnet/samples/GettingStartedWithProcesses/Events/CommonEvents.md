# Explanation
This code defines a static class `CommonEvents` within the `Events` namespace. The purpose of this class is to provide a set of constant event names (as `readonly string` fields) representing common events raised by shared steps in an application. The events include `UserInputReceived`, `UserInputComplete`, `AssistantResponseGenerated`, and `Exit`. By using the `nameof` operator, these event identifiers always match the names of the fields, ensuring consistency and reducing hard-coded string values.

public static class CommonEvents
{
    public static readonly string UserInputReceived = nameof(UserInputReceived);
    public static readonly string UserInputComplete = nameof(UserInputComplete);
    public static readonly string AssistantResponseGenerated = nameof(AssistantResponseGenerated);
    public static readonly string Exit = nameof(Exit);
}
