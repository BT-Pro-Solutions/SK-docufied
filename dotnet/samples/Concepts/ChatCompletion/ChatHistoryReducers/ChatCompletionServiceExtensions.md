# Explanation
This code defines an internal static extension class, `ChatCompletionServiceExtensions`, for enhancing the behavior of objects implementing the `IChatCompletionService` interface from the Microsoft.SemanticKernel.ChatCompletion namespace. Specifically, it provides the `UsingChatHistoryReducer` extension method, allowing an `IChatCompletionService` instance to be wrapped with additional functionality for reducing chat history using a provided `IChatHistoryReducer`. This can help manage the amount of chat data sent to a model, by preprocessing it before the completion service acts on it.
