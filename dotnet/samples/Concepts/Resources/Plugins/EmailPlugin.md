# Explanation

This C# code defines an internal plugin class named `EmailPlugin` within the `Plugins` namespace. It provides two main functions, both of which are annotated to be used as kernel functions (potentially for AI or plugin extensibility):

1. `SendEmail`: Simulates sending an email by taking a message body and an email address, then returning a string confirming that the email was "sent" with the specified details.
2. `GetEmailAddress`: Given a person's name, it looks up a hard-coded email address for that name and returns it. It also supports optional logging for trace purposes (logging is disabled by default).

This plugin is designed for integration scenarios where email-related functionality is needed, such as in chatbots, automation scripts, or AI orchestration using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel.

        [Description("The email address to send email to.")] string email_address) =>

        $"Sent email to: {email_address}. Body: {input}";

    [KernelFunction, Description("Given a name, find email address")]
    public string GetEmailAddress(
        [Description("The name of the person whose email address needs to be found.")] string input,
        ILogger? logger = null)
    {
        // Sensitive data, logging as trace, disabled by default
        logger?.LogTrace("Returning hard coded email for {0}", input);

        return input switch
